## Construction of machine learning models to predict credit card fraud

Fraud involving instant and/or online payments ranks as the second biggest concern for financial institutions. This is due to the significant losses, as we have seen, that this type of crime causes both for financial institutions and for their customers

## General Objective
To analyze credit card data and aim to improve fraud detection in credit card payments through machine learning methods.

Steps Taken
1. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and 
extract meaningful insights.

2. Verify possible correlations between the attributes.

3. Develop predictive models using machine learning techniques.

4. Evaluate the models to determine which one performs the best.
